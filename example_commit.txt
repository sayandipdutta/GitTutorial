Provide a good commit message example

The purpose of this commit is to provude an example of a hand-crafted, 
artisanal commit message. The first line is a short, approximately 50 
character summary, followed by an empty line. The subsequent paragraphs
are jam-packed with descriptive information abou the change, but each 
line is kept under 72 characters in length.

If even more informatuion is needed to explain the change, more 
paragraphs can be added after blank lines, with links to the issues, 
tickets, or bugs. Remember that future you will thank current you for 
your thoughtfulness and foresight!

# Then a few lines with "#"s that will be ignored.
